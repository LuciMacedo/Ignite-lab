## Overview
  Application with features where you can sign up the page with your email and access the page content for an Event where you can choose classes. 
  Not all the components have functionality a few of them are just following the layout.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Sign up the page for an Event.

### What I learned

While working through this project I learned more about states in React, tailwind, and async function.


### Continued development

Areas that I want to continue focusing on in future projects are GraphQl and Tailwind. I am still not completely comfortable with these techniques and I found them useful and want to refine them.
