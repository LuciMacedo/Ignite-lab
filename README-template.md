## Overview
  Application with features where you can sign up for the page with your email and access the page content for an Event where you can choose classes. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Post comments and also delete them.

### What I learned

While working through this project I learned more about states in React, tailwind, and async function.
